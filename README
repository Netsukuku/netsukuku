**
****  1. What is this?
**

Netsukuku is a mesh network or a p2p net system that generates and sustains
itself autonomously. It is designed to handle an unlimited number of nodes
with minimal CPU and memory resources. Thanks to this feature it can be easily
used to build a worldwide distributed, anonymous and not controlled network,
separated from the Internet, without the support of any servers, ISPs or
authority controls.
This net is composed by computers linked physically each other, therefore it
isn't build upon any existing network. Netsukuku builds only the routes which
connects all the computers of the net.
In other words, Netsukuku replaces the level 3 of the model iso/osi with
another routing protocol.
The Domain Name System is also replaced by a decentralised and distributed
system: the Abnormal Netsukuku Domain Name Anarchy.

The complete features list of Netsukuku is here:
http://netsukuku.freaknet.org/files/doc/misc/Ntk_features_list


In order to join to Netsukuku you have to use NetsukukuD, which is the daemon
implementing the Npv7 protocol.

Before doing anything, please read the documentation in doc/ or in
http://netsukuku.freaknet.org


**
****  2.  Get the code!
**

Get the tarball of the latest stable version from:
http://netsukuku.freaknet.org/files/


If you want to download the development code you have to checkout it from the
cvs repository:
(Warning: It is highly probable the development code will not work!)

$ cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@hinezumilabs.org:/home/cvsroot login
or
$ export CVSROOT=":pserver:anoncvs@hinezumilabs.org:/home/cvsroot"
$ cvs login

then check it out:

$ cvs -z3 -d :pserver:anoncvs@hinezumilabs.org:/home/cvsroot co netsukuku
or
$ cvs -z3 co netsukuku
(providing the CVSROOT variable was set in the previous step)


Once you've checked out a copy of the source tree, you can update 
your source tree at any time so it is in sync with the latest and 
greatest by running the command:
# cvs -z3 update -d -P


**
****  3.  Build and install
**

To compile the code you can use scons or just go with the old school way:

# ./configure && make && make install

But SCons is cooler:
http://www.scons.org/
(You should have installed at least the 2.4 version of Python in order to
avoid dirty bugs in scons)


The code depends also on the libgmp,zlib and openssl. Generally you have
already them installed on your system, but eventually you can retrieve them
here: 
for the libgmp:			http://www.swox.com/gmp/
the openssl library here:	http://openssl.org
and finally the zlibs:		http://zlib.net

Then go in the src/ directory and type:
$ scons --help

That will show you all the options you can use in the build and installation
process. Finally execute:

$ scons 

The code will be compiled. If all went well install NetsukukuD with:

# scons install

Now you should give a look at /etc/netsukuku.conf (or wherever you installed
it) and modify it for your needs, but generally the default options are good.

- Notes:

If you want to change some scons option to do another installation, (i.e. you
may want to reinstall it with another MANDIR path), you have to run:
$ scons --clean


**
****  3.1  Static Binaries and Packages
**

If you prefer to just install Netsukuku, without compiling it, you can
download the static binaries suitable to your platform. They come packed in
various formats (.tgz, .deb, .ipk).
The packages repository is at:
    http://netsukuku.freaknet.org/packages/


**
****  4.  Kernel dependencies
**

On Linux be sure to have the following options set in your kernel .config.
These options are taken from linux-2.6.14.
 
	#
	# Networking options
	#
	CONFIG_PACKET=y
	CONFIG_UNIX=y
	CONFIG_INET=y
	CONFIG_IP_MULTICAST=y
	CONFIG_IP_ADVANCED_ROUTER=y
	CONFIG_IP_MULTIPLE_TABLES=y
	CONFIG_IP_ROUTE_MULTIPATH=y
	CONFIG_NET_IPIP=y
	CONFIG_NETFILTER=y

and these from linux-2.6.16.19.

	#
	# Core Netfilter Configuration
	#

	CONFIG_NETFILTER_XT_MATCH_CONNTRACK=y
	NETFILTER_XT_TARGET_CONNMARK=y

	#
	# IP: Netfilter Configuration
	#

	CONFIG_IP_NF_IPTABLES=y
	CONFIG_IP_NF_FILTER=y
	CONFIG_IP_NF_TARGET_REJECT=y
	CONFIG_IP_NF_NAT=y
	CONFIG_IP_NF_NAT_NEEDED=y
	CONFIG_IP_NF_TARGET_MASQUERADE=y
	
If you are using modules you have to load them before launching the daemon.


**
****  5.  How to use it
**

Before doing anything do:

$ man ntkd
$ man andna

when you feel confortable and you are ready to dare type with root
priviledges:

# ntkd

then just wait... ^_-

(For the first times it's cool to use the -D option to see what happens).

-  Note:
The daemon at startup takes the list of all the network interfaces which are
currently UP and it uses all of them to send and receive packets. If you want
to force the daemon to use specific interfaces you should use the B<-i>
option.

> IRC

We live night and day in IRC, come to see us on channel
   #netsukuku

**
****  7.  Bug report
**

{ Don't panic! }

If you encounter any bug, please report it.
Use the online bug track system:
    http://bugs.dyne.org/
or the mailing list:
    http://lists.dyne.org/netsukuku/
and explain what the problem is and if possible a way to reproduce it.


**
****  8.  Hack the code
**

Feel free to debug, patch, modify and eat the code. Then submit your results
to the mailing list ^_-

There is a lot to code too! If you are a Kung Foo coder, get on board and
help the development writing some nice poems. For a start you can take a look
at the src/TODO file.
