Subject: Internet Gateway Search

----
This text describes a change to the Npv7.
It will be included in the final documentation, so feel free to correct it.
But if you want to change the system here described, please contact us first.

If the nodes are in restricted mode (compatibility with the Internet), they
should share their Internet connection. This can be easily done, in fact, if
a node X, connected to the Internet, activates the masquerading, it is
possible for the other nodes to connect by setting as the default gateway
their rnode which lead to the node X.

This can be automated by Netsukuku itself and it requires small changes in the
code: it is just necessary that the nodes connected to the Internet set a flag
in the qspn_pkt, in this way the other nodes will know the routes to reach the
Internet.

=== Multi-gateways ===

The situation becomes a little complex when there is more than one node which
shares its internet connection. Let's consider this scenario:

{{{
		   A(gw)      B(gw)
		    \	       /
		     \___  ___/
		         \/
		      Ntk nodes (10.x.x.x)
}}}

A and B are nodes which shares their internet connection, we call them
gateways. Let's call X the node which wants to connect to an Internet host.
In this case, the nodes near A, might find useful to use A itself to
reach the Internet, the same happens for the nodes near B.
Instead, the nodes in the middle don't know what is the best choice and they
might continuosly change their gw. This means that a tcp connection
(to an inet host), which was established trough A, when is then routed trough
B dies because A and B have different public IPs on the Internet.

The node X has to create an IPIP tunnel to the gateway it wants to use, and
set as default gw the tunnel. In this way, the node X is sure to always use
the same gateway while the routing of the packets between it and the gw is
made transparently by the other Netsukuku nodes.

==== Anti loop multi-inet_gw shield ====

An inet-gw is a normal node like all the other, therefore it can use the
Internet connections of the other inet-gws in conjunction with its own one.

Consider the previous scenario, A and B are two inet-gw. 
A sets in his internet default route the adsl modem and B.
B does the same, but sets A as the second default route.

What would happen if the default route, written in the routing cache of A, is
B and, at the same time, the default route set in the routing cache of B is A?
The packets would jump endlessy in a infinite loop loosing themself forever.

That's why we need the "anti loop multi-inet_gw shield".
It's working way is simple: each inet-gw has a netfilter rule which marks
all the packets coming from the outside and directed to the Internet. These
packets are then routed directly to the Internet without being sent, again, to
an inet-gw. In the example:
A wants to send a packet to the Internet and its looks in its routing cache.
It decide to forward the packet to B. B receives the packet, recognizes it is
an extern packet directed to the Internet and shoots it on its modem.

=== Load sharing ===

Let's consider the previous scenario.

The node X can also decide to use both A and B to reach the Internet, using
at the same time their connections! Even the gw A can use at the same time
its own line and the connection of the gw B.

The procedure to implement this is what follows:

 * X creates a tunnel to A and another one to B
 
 * X adds in the routing table the default route using A and B as multipath
gateways. The gateway for the connections is chosen randomly.

 * X adds a rule in the routing table to route all the packets of established
connections trough the same gateway used to create the same connection.
The rule is linked to some netfilter rules which track and mark each
connection. The method is described in details here:
https://lists.netfilter.org/pipermail/netfilter/2006-March/065005.html

=== The bad ===

The implementation of the Load sharing is very Linux specific, so it will be
very difficult to port it to other kernels, therefore this feature will be
available only to nodes which run Linux (ehi, one more reason to use Linux ;).

=== MASQUERADING ===

Each node sharing the Internet connection (inet-gw) has to masquerade its
interfaces, so iptables must be used.
In order to keep the daemon portable, NetsukukuD will launch the script found
at /etc/netsukuku/masquerade.sh, which in Linux will be a simple script that
executes "iptables -A POSTROUTING -t nat -j MASQUERADE".
When NetsukukuD is closed the added firewall rules are flushed with 
"/etc/netsukuku/masquerade.sh close"


=== Traffic shaping ===

The inet-gw can also shape its internet connection in order to prioritize its
local outgoing traffic (the traffic coming from its 192.168.x.x LAN). 
In this way, even if it shares its Internet connection, it won't notice any
difference 'cause it will have the first priority. Moreover with the traffic
shaper, the inet-gw can also prioritize some protocol, i.e. SSH.

The traffic shaper will activated at the start of NetsukukuD. The daemon will
run the /etc/netsukuku/tc_shaper.sh script, which in Linux utilizes the
iproute2 userspace utility.
When the daemon is closed the traffic shaping will be disabled with
"/etc/netsukuku/tc_shaper.sh close".
